Fist of Vim

Fast, simple and super awesome Gist-ing for Vim.

For the latest version of this plugin, go to: https://github.com/ajh17/vim-fist

Setup
====

Fist of Vim depends on the gist command line tool. You can install and configure it by running:

    [sudo] gem install gist
    gist --login

Usage
=====

Fist of Vim defines these mappings:

<leader>p - Create a new gist

<leader>u - Update an existing gist

<leader>l - List your gists

Fist of Vim also sets the filetype and syntax completely automatically without you having to set it! Impressive, huh?

You can use Fist of Vim with a visual selection, or in normal mode, in which case, it is motion based.

For example, in normal mode, <leader>pG will create a new gist from the cursor to the end of file. In visual mode, simply visually select what you want gisted and then hit <leader>p to create a new gist.
