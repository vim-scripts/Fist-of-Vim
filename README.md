# fist.vim
Fast, simple and super awesome Gist-ing for Vim.

<sub>If there were any more superlatives, I would be charging for this!</sub>


## Dependencies

- [gist](https://github.com/defunkt/gist.git)


## Install

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend installing
[pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and then simply copy and
paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/ajh17/vim-fist.git

Once the helptags have been generated, see `:h vim-fist` for usage.


## Setup

First, you want to make sure you have the gist command line setup and happy:

    [sudo] gem install gist
    gist --login

And you're done! Why are you still reading this? Go fist!


## FAQ
> What is the deal with the name "Fist"?

Taken from <i>"<b>F</b>ast G<b>ist</b> for Vim that is totally awesome"</i>. Or
because "Gisty" was too good and was already taken. Or because the Author
racked his brain and couldn't think of anything else. You get to decide! Either
way, Fist.vim was born!

> Why another gist plugin for Vim?

Mostly as a (small) exercise, but which one would you rather use? A 35 line
plugin or a 1000 line plugin if both do essentially the same thing?
